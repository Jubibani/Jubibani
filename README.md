- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jubibani.
  When i was little, i grew up with lego toys, building toys and puzzle toys. I also loved fixing my broken toys to play with others. I called it "reviving" because i had no money to buy another.
My first career choice was going in the military because I was influenced by my father and uncle and I really fell in love with military. --But I slowly got myself interested and passionate about tech. currently, i am pursuing web development by career and a game development by hobby.
this is where i realized that i love to build and fix things.
